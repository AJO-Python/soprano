    "A different problem when dealing with the results of random structure searching is how to group together a number of predicted defect positions that might be crystallographically equivalent. In Soprano, this is helped by a clustering gene called `defect_asymmetric_fdist`, for \"asymmetric fractional distance\". This is a pair gene (it only computes a distance between pairs of structures and only allows for hierarchical clustering), and it computes how close in fractional coordinates two defects can get if all possible symmetry operations that apply to a given pure structure are tried to bring them together. The distance itself has no specific physical meaning as it's in fractional space, but it works well to group the defects together if there's a meaningful structure to begin with. The gene requires having the space group library `spglib` installed."
