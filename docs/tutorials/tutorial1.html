            <p>
                Soprano draws inspiration from the structure of the <a href="https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/">Atomic Simulation Environment</a>, a very useful Python library to read and manipulated individual atomic structures. Soprano, however, takes things a level further. Just like ASE's main class is <code>Atoms</code>, an object storing the properties of an atomic structure like atomic positions, elements, crystallographic unit cell, and so on, Soprano's main class is <code>AtomsCollection</code>, which contains multiple 
                <code>Atoms</code> objects. These could be, for example, the output of a random structure search calculations, or all the steps of a transition state trajectory. Soprano then is designed to allow the user to extract information and perform operations on these structures all at once, or analyse and cluster them based on their properties.

            <p>
                In this first tutorial we focus on the simplest tasks: reading input files and manipulating <code>AtomsCollection</code> objects in a basic way. To begin with, <a href="data/structs.zip">download this zip file containing ten structure files</a>. These are ten structures representing crystalline iron in either FCC or BCC form, with some random rattling on the atoms to make them more interesting. We don't much care about that for this tutorial, though. Unzip them, then in the same folder create a python script and write:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code class="language-python">
                    import glob
                    from soprano.collection import AtomsCollection

                    cifs = glob.glob('struct*.cif')
                    aColl = AtomsCollection(cifs, progress=True)
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p>
                This will load all the files in the folder into a single collection, with a progress bar for the loading (this may be useful for cases in which the loading is slower because many more structures are used; here it should be instantaneous). Collections are designed to help you manipulate these structures in way that are intuitive. For example, you can do all of the following:             
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code class="language-python">
                    print(len(aColl))                       # Print the number of structures that have been loaded
                    aCollFirst5 = aColl[:5]                 # A new collection, containing only the first five structures
                    aCollLast = aColl[-1]                   # A new collection, containing the last structure

                    aCollSum = aCollFirst5 + aCollLast      # Chain two collections
                </code>
            </pre>      
            <p>
                This is not all. For example, collections are iterable. Each element is an ASE <code>Atoms</code> object. Here's an example in which we use ASE's <code>.get_volume()</code> method to print the volume of all these structures:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code class="language-python">
                    for a in aColl:
                        print(a.get_volume())
                </code>
            </pre>     
            <p>
                Since wanting to access information of all structures however is pretty common, collections also have a special member: the object <code>.all</code>. Using <code>.all</code>,
                you can access the entire collection using the same methods available for an ASE <code>Atoms</code> object - except it returns an array with all the values inside. For example we could do what we've done above with:
            </p> 
            <pre>
                <code class="language-python">
                    print(aColl.all.get_volume())
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                Two other advanced ways to use collections are filtering and classifying. <code>.filter</code> is a method that takes a function, evaluates it for each <code>Atoms</code> object in the collection, and returns a collection of only those <code>Atoms</code> objects for which the function returned True. For example, here's how you would filter only cells that have a volume bigger than a certain value:
            </p>    
            <pre>
                <code class="language-python">
                    def isBig(a):
                        return a.get_volume() >= 47

                    aCollBig = aColl.filter(isBig)

                    print('{0} structures have V >= 47'.format(len(aCollBig)))
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                <code>.classify</code> instead splits the collection into a dictionary of collections, following an array of integers that indicates which class each <code>Atoms</code> belongs to. For example, here we split the collection based on the volume of each structure, rounded down:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code class="language-python">
                    volumes = aColl.all.get_volume()
                    classes = [int(np.floor(v)) for v in volumes]

                    aCollHist = aColl.classify(classes)

                    for v, c in aCollHist.items():
                        print('{0} structures with volume within {1} and {2}'.format(len(c), v, v+1))
                </code>
            </pre>            
            <p>
                This covers the basics of how to use the <code>AtomsCollection</code> object. Next tutorial will deal with ways to create collections as well as extracting complex information from them: <code>Generator</code> and <code>AtomsProperty</code>.
